# deep-learning-cnn

I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network on a big image dataset. I used [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) but you can use also different deep layer framework.

The code implements a basic NN and CNN, the data loading, the training phase and the evaluation (testing) phase. The training and testing are on CIFAR 100 dataset (already included in Pytorch).

**Hint:** I suggest you to do not use your NVIDIA card (or other) in your PC. Usually it does not have a well done Deep Learning framework setup. So, you can use [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): a very user friendly python notebook from Google in which you can install python packages, download datasets, plot images, and you have a free GPU to do trainings!

# Main concepts



# NN Class

It trains a traditional 2 hidden layers + last FC layer network on the CIFAR 100 train set.

# CNN Class

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
